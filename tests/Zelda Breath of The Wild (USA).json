The good news is that the last remaining bug (shader caches loading issue) has been solved in experimental release 0.49 ! Now shader and pipelines load correctly (currently at 20k vulkan pipelines cached) albeit with a downside, as the cached vulkan pipelines now take much longer to load than before (2-3 minutes with 20 000 pipelines). Shader cache loading speed is unaffected. Keep in mind you need to set up the graphical packs correctly to get the best performance (disable fence and vulkan accurate barriers).",
