The only big bug missing is often the game will not boot unless you delete the vulkan shaders cache each time. Also keep in mind you need to set up the graphical packs correctly to get the best performance.",

Everything else works just fine, so you can still have a ton of fun while you wait for those few bugs to be fixed.
